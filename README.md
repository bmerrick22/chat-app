## About
This is a personal project I took on with the goal of learning more about NodeJS, WebSockets, and how Angular fits into it all. It is a simple chat application where users are prompted with a login, and upon successful login, re-directed to the main chat home page where you can begin chatting. This is still a work in progress, but please enjoy my progress so far! 

## Testing
After downloading the project, enter the following into the terminal in the directory of the application.
```bash
$ npm install
```
Once completed, enter the following to begin the angular application
```bash
$ ng serve
```
Open a new terminal and enter the following to begin the Node server
```bash
$ cd server
$ npm start
```
Once completed, open a new browser and navigate to the following to begin interacting with the chat application
```bash
localhost:4200
```
The two test username and passwords are...
```bash
--Root--
username: root
password: root

--Root2--
username: root2
password: root2
```
