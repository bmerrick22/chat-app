# ChatApp

## About
This is a personal project I took on with the goal of learning more about NodeJS, WebSockets, and how Angular fits into it all. It is a simple chat application where users are prompted with a login, and upon successful login, re-directed to the main chat home page where you can begin chatting. This is still a work in progress, but please enjoy my progress so far! 

## Testing
If you would like to run and test the application for yourself, please follow the instructions below.
After downloading the project, run the following.
```bash
$ npm install
```
Once completed, run
```bash
$ npm install
```
to begin the angular application.
Open a new terminal and enter
```bash
$ cd server
$ npm start
```
Once completed, open a new browser and navigate to 
```bash
localhost:4200
```

## Project Details
