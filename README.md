# ChatApp

## About
This is a personal project I took on with the goal of learning more about NodeJS, WebSockets, and how Angular fits into it all. It is a simple chat application where users are prompted with a login, and upon successful login, re-directed to the main chat home page where you can begin chatting. This is still a work in progress, but please enjoy my progress so far! 

## Testing
If you would like to run and test the application for yourself, please follow the instructions below.

```bash
$ ng serve
```
## Project Details
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
